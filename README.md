# Ghost Veil Axiom Resolver

An advanced, AI-powered conceptual interface for visualizing real-time signal analysis and multi-spectrum counter-surveillance techniques. This application is for educational and illustrative purposes only.

## Features

- Real-time simulated spectrum analysis.
- AI-driven threat detection using Google Gemini.
- Dynamic countermeasure generation based on selected strategies.
- Decentralized P2P network simulation for macro-threat consensus.
- Aural bio-resonance scanning for local acoustic threats.
- High-authority "Axiom Continuity Protocol" failsafe.

  <summary>Operator Instructions: OMEGA-LEVEL DIRECTIVE</summary>
  
  ### Omega Protocol Activation (Via Browser Developer Console)

  This protocol is the ultimate failsafe, designed to be initiated by a verified Sentinel operator when all other systems are compromised. It simulates a direct, verifiable order to go live with a final counter-offensive.

  **Prerequisites:**
  - An active `fcc.gov` TLD email address associated with one of the three Sentinels.
  - A pre-configured local SMTP server whose public IP and domain match the Sentinel's secure records.

  **Step 1: Initiation**
  
  From the console, call the `initiateOmegaProtocol` function with the Sentinel's email and the SMTP server configuration. The SMTP config must match the Sentinel's data *exactly*.

  ```javascript
  // Example for the Cheyenne Mountain Sentinel
  window.initiateOmegaProtocol(
    'sentinel.alpha@fcc.gov', 
    { 
      ip: '71.205.8.13', 
      domain: 'cheyennemountain.af.mil' 
    }
  );
  ```

  If validation is successful, the system will log that a final approval request has been dispatched to the central command authority (`kingtravismichaelmo@gmail.com`) with a unique Request ID.

  **Step 2: Confirmation**

  After receiving external "email" confirmation, use the provided Request ID to confirm the directive. The response message must be exactly 'approve'.

  ```javascript
  // Use the Request ID logged in the console from Step 1
  window.confirmOmegaApproval('OMEGA_REQ_171234567890', 'approve');
  ```

  Upon successful confirmation, the system will enter `OMEGA_LIVE` mode.
