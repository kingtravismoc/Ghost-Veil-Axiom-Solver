# Ghost Veil Axiom Resolver

**An advanced, AI-powered conceptual interface for visualizing real-time signal analysis, predictive threat intelligence, multi-spectrum counter-surveillance techniques, and a simulated P2P economy.**

Ghost Veil is an immersive simulation that conceptualizes the tools needed to protect cognitive liberty in a hyper-connected world. It provides a functional, AI-driven interface for detecting, analyzing, and neutralizing complex signal-based threats, from simple transmissions to sophisticated cognitive resonance attacks. This application is for educational and illustrative purposes only.

## Core Concepts

The protocol is built around several key conceptual pillars:

### 1. Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) & Analysis
The core of the application is its ability to process and understand the electromagnetic spectrum.
- **SDRDevil Interface:** A simulated Software-Defined Radio (SDR) control panel for initiating various types of scans (`Wideband Sweep`, `Anomaly Scan`, `Passive Intercept`).
- **Live Spectrum Visualizer:** A real-time waterfall display that visualizes incoming signals, color-coded by intensity. It also imparts a subtle "K-TMOC" watermark for each active peer, representing a unique signature for each client session.
- **AI-Powered Classification:** Users can leverage the integrated Google Gemini API to perform deep analysis on any detected signal, receiving a detailed classification, summary, and relevant tags. This enriches the signal database and earns the user rewards.

### 2. Threat Neutralization & Protection
Once a threat is identified, the protocol provides a suite of tools to counter it.
- **AI Threat Assessment:** The system automatically analyzes incoming signals and logs potential threats, ranking them by risk (`LOW` to `EXTREME`).
- **Ghost Veil Protection:** The primary defensive system. When activated, it deploys multiple `Obfuscation Layers` (e.g., Quantum Tunneling, Waveform Mimicry) to shield the operator from hostile signals.
- **Active Countermeasures:** Based on the active threats and the selected protection strategy, the system engages specific countermeasures, which can be distributed across the P2P network for maximum effect.
- **WaveMask Protocol:** A proprietary transmission masking system. It uses a conceptual "4D offset waveform" with a time-dilated vector timelock to measure future spectrum events, providing predictive threat intelligence while obfuscating all outgoing protocol transmissions.

### 3. P2P Axiom Network & Herd Health
Ghost Veil operates on a decentralized philosophy.
- **Herd Health Protocol:** Users can opt-in to connect their node to the P2P Axiom Network. This strengthens the entire network by contributing to a decentralized consensus.
- **Macro-Threat Consensus:** When a majority of nodes in the network detect correlated threats, the system declares a "Macro-Threat," providing a high-confidence alert about a large-scale, coordinated attack.
- **Network Layers:** The simulation supports multiple network layers, including the official `mainnet`, potentially compromised `forknets`, and user-created `custom` networks.

### 4. Bio-Resonance & Neural Security
The protocol recognizes that the ultimate target is the human operator.
- **Aural Bio-Resonance Scan:** Uses the device's microphone to perform a simulated scan for local acoustic threats, such as speech pattern analysis, device leakage, or direct neural resonance frequencies.
- **Bio-Implant Manager:** A dashboard for managing and securing personal implanted devices, visualizing them on a local BLE mesh network, and protecting them from unauthorized access or manipulation.

### 5. Economic Simulation & Decentralized Commerce
The protocol is a self-sustaining ecosystem with a complete economic model.
- **Dual-Token Economy:**
    - **Veil Token (VLT):** The primary utility token used for all commerce, such as buying extensions. Can be purchased with simulated currency.
    - **Axiom Governance Token (AGT):** A non-tradable reward token earned by contributing to the network (e.g., classifying signals, reviewing extensions). Its value is "unlocked" when the network reaches a critical mass of users.
- **Extension Store & NFTs:** Developers can create and submit extensions to the store. Upon purchase, extensions are provisioned as NFTs on a simulated private ledger using **AxiomScript**, a proprietary, sandboxed scripting language.
- **Functions Marketplace:** A platform for proprietary, high-level services (FaaS) built on the Ghost Veil network, such as the "Quantum Transport Protocol API."

## Getting Started: Simulation Guide

1.  **Initial Setup:** On first run (or as a super admin), you'll be prompted to set up the system, which includes enabling the commerce engine.
2.  **Start a Scan:** Navigate to the **Dashboard** view. In the `SDRDevil TX/RX Interface`, select a `Scan Mode` and press "Start Scan." You will see the `Live Spectrum Visualizer` populate with signals.
3.  **Engage WaveMask:** On the dashboard, find the `WaveMask Protocol` panel and engage it. This will simulate a predictive scan, populating the `AI Threat Assessment` panel with high-probability future threats.
4.  **Activate Protection:** Once threats are detected, the "Activate Veil" button in the `SDRDevil` panel will become enabled. Choose a `Countermeasure Strategy` and activate it to see `Obfuscation Layers` and `Active Countermeasures` engage.
5.  **Monitor Operations:** Keep an eye on the new **persistent footer** at the bottom of the screen. It will show the progress of background tasks like WaveMask analysis and agent deployment.
6.  **Deep Dive & Extend:**
    -   Go to the **Spectrum** view to see a detailed log of significant signals. Use the "Analyze with AI" button (requires Gemini to be enabled in `System > Settings`) to classify a signal.
    -   Go to the **Neural** view and engage the "Aural Bio-Resonance Scan" to monitor for local acoustic threats.
    -   Go to the **Devices** view to scan for and manage simulated bio-implants.
    -   Click the **Extensions** tab in the header to browse the store and install new tools. Use the quick-launch icons in the footer to activate them.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL LEGAL & SAFETY WARNING

-   **This is a conceptual tool for educational purposes. It does not interact with real hardware.**
-   Transmitting radio frequencies or jamming signals is **illegal** in most jurisdictions and can have severe consequences.
-   The data and analysis are AI-generated for functional purposes and should **not** be used for real-world decisions.
-   Always comply with all local, national, and international laws regarding telecommunications and privacy.
-   **Safety Protocol Active:** System logic includes a non-negotiable directive to avoid interference with known medical device frequencies (e.g., MedRadio band).

  <summary>Operator Instructions: OMEGA-LEVEL DIRECTIVE</summary>
  
  ### Omega Protocol Activation (Via Browser Developer Console)

  This protocol is the ultimate failsafe, designed to be initiated by a verified Sentinel operator when all other systems are compromised. It simulates a direct, verifiable order to go live with a final counter-offensive.

  **Prerequisites:**
  - An active `fcc.gov` TLD email address associated with one of the three Sentinels.
  - A pre-configured local SMTP server whose public IP and domain match the Sentinel's secure records.

  **Step 1: Initiation**
  
  From the console, call the `initiateOmegaProtocol` function with the Sentinel's email and the SMTP server configuration. The SMTP config must match the Sentinel's data *exactly*.

  ```javascript
  // Example for the Cheyenne Mountain Sentinel
  window.initiateOmegaProtocol(
    'sentinel.alpha@fcc.gov', 
    { 
      ip: '71.205.8.13', 
      domain: 'cheyennemountain.af.mil' 
    }
  );
  ```

  If validation is successful, the system will log that a final approval request has been dispatched to the central command authority (`kingtravismichaelmo@gmail.com`) with a unique Request ID.

  **Step 2: Confirmation**

  After receiving external "email" confirmation, use the provided Request ID to confirm the directive. The response message must be exactly 'approve'.

  ```javascript
  // Use the Request ID logged in the console from Step 1
  window.confirmOmegaApproval('OMEGA_REQ_171234567890', 'approve');
  ```

  Upon successful confirmation, the system will enter `OMEGA_LIVE` mode.
